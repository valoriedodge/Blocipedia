#Blocipedia

##A production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis.

Blocipedia was created as a resource to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills to build both public and private wikis. These wikis can be kept private allowing users to add collaborators as needed, or they can be made public allowing anyone to give input and improve the content of the wiki. Private wikis are only available to premium users (paying a monthly subscription facilitated through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payments).
